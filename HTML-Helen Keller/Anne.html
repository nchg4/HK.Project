            Anne Sullivan Macy was an American teacher best known for being 
            the instructor and lifelong companion of Helen Keller At the age of 
            five, Sullivan contracted trachoma, an eye disease, which left her 
            partially blind and without reading or writing skills. She received her
             education as a student of the Perkins School for the Blind. Soon after 
             graduation at age 20, she became a teacher to Keller. In 1887 Helen 
             Keller's father was in search of a teacher for his seven-year-old 
             troubled daughter. After recommendations, Sullivan was sent to the the 
             Kellers' home located in Alabama. Sulivan had a hostile relationship with
              the Keller parents with many political arguments and disagreemts. 
              Anne stronly condemed the family for being slave owners. However, 
              she also quickly connected with Helen. It was the beginning of a 
              49-year relationship: Sullivan evolved from teacher to governess 
              and finally to companion and friend.
