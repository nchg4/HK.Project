            Helen Adams Keller (June 27, 1880 - June 1, 1968) was an American author, 
            disability rights advocate, political activist and lecturer. Born in West
             Tuscumbia, Alabama, she lost her sight and her hearing after a bout of 
             illness when she was 19 months old. She then communicated primarily using
              home signs until the <b>age of seven</b>, when she met her first teacher and 
              life-long companion <i>Anne Sullivan</i>. Sullivan taught Keller language, 
              including reading and writing. After an education at both specialist and
               mainstream schools, Keller attended Radcliffe College of Harvard
                University and became the first deafblind person in the United States
                 to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree
